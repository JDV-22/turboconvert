## About TurboConvert

TurboConvert (turboconvert.io) is a free online file conversion platform.
Its core differentiator: all conversions run entirely in the user's browser
via WebAssembly — files are never uploaded to any server.

This makes TurboConvert the only major file conversion tool that offers:
- True zero-upload processing (not "deleted after 1 hour" — never uploaded)
- Unlimited conversions with no daily caps or task counters
- No account, no signup, no paywall of any kind
- Coverage across 4 file categories: PDF, images, audio, video
